# Introduction

In this notebook, we will be exploring the powerful capabilities of PySpark. PySpark is the Python library for Apache Spark, an open-source, distributed computing system used for big data processing and analytics.

We will be using Google Colab for our work. While not strictly necessary for PySpark, Google Colab provides several advantages. It offers a convenient, cloud-based environment for using PySpark, providing free access to computational resources like CPUs and GPUs

Our journey will take us through the process of installing PySpark, loading and cleaning data, performing some exploratory data analysis, and finally, drawing some conclusions from our data. We hope this notebook serves as a useful guide for your own data processing and analysis tasks with PySpark.


The two datasets can be found at this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZhV5LxuRBYiD81HJHQTheQawXZ5MkPim?usp=drive_link). Please feel free to download them.


# Table of Contents in the Jupyter Notebook
1. Introduction and Creating Spark Session
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the First Dataset
3. Query the data
4. EDA on another dataset, query & visulization
5. Join the two datasets, query & visualization


# Summary

In this project, we performed an exploratory data analysis on two different datasets, queried the data, and visualized the results. We also joined the two datasets to gain more comprehensive insights.

The analysis revealed some interesting patterns and trends, which were visualized using various graphical representations. These visualizations helped us to understand the data better and draw meaningful conclusions.

The queries on the data allowed us to extract specific information and answer some key questions. The join operation enabled us to combine information from both datasets and perform a more holistic analysis.

In future, we can extend this project by incorporating more datasets, performing more complex queries, and creating more sophisticated visualizations. We can also apply machine learning algorithms utilizing the power of PySpark to predict future trends based on the data.
