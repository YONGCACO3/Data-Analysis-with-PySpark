# Introduction

In this notebook, we will be exploring the powerful capabilities of PySpark. PySpark is the Python library for Apache Spark, an open-source, distributed computing system used for big data processing and analytics.

We will be using Google Colab for our work. While not strictly necessary for PySpark, Google Colab provides several advantages. It offers a convenient, cloud-based environment for using PySpark, providing free access to computational resources like CPUs and GPUs

Our journey will take us through the process of installing PySpark, loading and cleaning data, performing some exploratory data analysis, and finally, drawing some conclusions from our data. We hope this notebook serves as a useful guide for your own data processing and analysis tasks with PySpark.
